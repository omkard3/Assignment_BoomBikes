## General Information
General Information
This project aims to analyze the effect of various factors on the total rental bike count (cnt) and provide insights into what drives rental demand. The analysis focuses on:
* Categorical variables like season, weather situation, holidays, and working days.
* Numerical variables like temperature.
### Business Problem
The goal is to understand the key factors that influence bike rentals to help BoomBikes optimize bike availability and provide better service to customers. This will also aid in forecasting rental demand based on weather patterns and seasonal trends.

### Dataset
The dataset used contains features like season, temperature, weather conditions, holiday indicators, and the count of total rental bikes (cnt).
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
* Season: Seasons significantly impact bike rentals, with higher rentals in summer and fall due to favorable weather conditions.
* Weather Situation: Clear or partly cloudy weather leads to higher bike rentals, while mist, clouds, or worse weather conditions negatively affect demand.
* Holiday and Working Day: Rentals tend to be lower on holidays, while working days, particularly during favorable seasons, see more consistent rentals.
* Temperature: Higher temperatures generally boost bike rentals as warmer weather is more conducive to biking, especially for leisure purposes.
